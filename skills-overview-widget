  <div class="phrase" data-info="Facilitated by Elizabeth Wendel, this session will focus on how for too long, 'safety planning' in child welfare has focused on compliance-driven checklists rather than the lived experiences of children, families, and their communities. What if, instead of managing safety, we facilitated safety-building—a process grounded in relationships, networks, and long-term well-being? This session will introduce a new tool developed by our organization to shift power back to families and communities, emphasizing connection over control.">

  <div class="phrase" data-info="Led by Dan Comer, this skills session will shine a light on polarity, the relationship between two opposite but interrelated characteristics, thoughts, opinions, or tendencies (identified as separate poles). This concept helps us to see that both poles are equally necessary, important, and/or valued, and that we do not need to, nor should we, limit ourselves to an either/or approach.">

  <div class="phrase" data-info="Kamilah Clayton will present this skills session, integrating Kevin Campbell's groundbreaking work on Family Finding® which has revolutionized the way child welfare thinks about and explores the possibilities that exist within a family’s network of support. Campbell’s work continues to shape the way child welfare workers engage with families to understand who they consider a support, and in what ways these individuals or groups can contribute to plans that ensure child safety. For communities that have always prioritized the interconnectedness of people, Family Finding® can feel like a validation of their lived experience, but it can also reveal relationship dynamics that require additional work to resolve so that network members can communicate and plan together.">

  <div class="phrase" data-info="Emotional labor is defined as any piece of a job where a worker is responsible for both display rules of the organization as well as fostering an emotional climate where work goals can be met. First coined as a concept in the work of flight attendants, emotional labor is a primary component in our work in child and family service settings. It shows up when we help de-escalate conflict, when we empathize with families and children, and when we work to help families make needed changes. This skills session, facilitated by Ida Drury, PhD, MSW, will provide additional information on all the facets of emotional labor. Participants will complete a self-evaluation and talk about all the ways you practice emotional labor every day as well as strategies for resilience.">

Whether in leadership, community organising, or everyday activism, relationships shape our ability to inspire change, navigate resistance, and build trust across divides. Why does relational activism matter? How do we turn conversations into meaningful action? Discover how everyday interactions can become powerful acts of change! In this session, you will join Tim Fisher and Kar-Man to discuss and do exercises to improve your communication, hopeful resilience, and capacity to foster inclusive spaces.">

<div class="phrase" data-info="The ability to truly connect with people is a fundamental skill in social services, especially when working with families and individuals in challenging situations. Often, direct practitioners are trained to focus on the technical aspects of their role—filling out forms, asking specific questions, and documenting answers—but they may miss the deeper, human connection that can make a lasting difference in the lives of the people they serve. Valerie Frost, MAEd, will lead this skills session, focusing on developing skills to shift from transactional to relational interactions. Participants will explore the power of empathetic listening, asking open-ended questions, and engaging families in a way that fosters trust and authentic dialogue. This shift allows professionals to better understand the complex lives and challenges of the families they work with, leading to more meaningful assessments and better outcomes.">

<div class="phrase" data-info="Facilitated by Michelle Mares, this session will explore how prior to a thought, prior to a word, and prior to an act, exists internal stimuli.  Without being completely aware of, our bodies reveal internal states that precede language, thought, and action. When we learn the when and the how hormones (and other chemicals) lead our bodies to respond in very predictable and specific ways, we can become more proactive and preventative within hostile situations, communications and relations.">

This awareness gives us the power to shift our response, often the only thing truly within our control- how we respond. Krystal Grint will deliver this interactive, hands-on session diving into the unconscious thought patterns that guide us, and helping us discover how changing our mindset can transform the way we experience life.">
