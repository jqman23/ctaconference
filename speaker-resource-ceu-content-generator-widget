Information and resources on this page are not intended to replace the official <a href="https://cvent.me/YRmVVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[var(--primary-blue)] underline">Speaker Portal & Questionnaire</a>, which is where where you can review the date and time for your session(s), adjust your presentation details, update your speaker profile, upload documents and links, and answer important questions in the Speaker Questionnaire.</p>

        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">
          We are excited to offer the ability for most speakers to offer CEUs, or Continuing Education Units, to US-based Licensed Social Workers, Licensed Marriage &amp; Family Therapists, and Licensed Mental Health Counselors. We expect over 200 attendees will claim CEUs this year. They are more likely to attend sessions that offer CEU credit.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">
          A significant amount of back-end work goes into making the automated CEU process easy to navigate for attendees and speakers. For instance:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800 space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            Attendees have the ability to receive 50+ hours of CEU credit by engaging in live and recorded sessions, which are clearly labeled as CEU Eligible. To receive CEU credit, they participate in the session and then complete a brief 3-question knowledge check survey based on the questions speakers provide.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the event concludes, attendees are emailed a special URL uniquely tied to their participation. This allows them to download a certificate naming the total CEU credits received along with a transcript of all session names.
          </li>
          <li>
            This certificate automatically updates itself whenever attendees complete a new knowledge check survey.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-6 text-gray-800">
          We ask that at least one speaker on behalf of each CEU-eligible session submit 3 knowledge-check questions (True/False or Multiple-Choice) and 3 measurable objectives (i.e., lessons learned) through the

This interactive workshop offers a multidimensional perspective that blends lived experiences from a former foster youth, frontline insights from a former child welfare professional, and peer-reviewed research to spark transformative dialogue. This session aims to build community across difference by shifting the narrative away from the binary debate and towards a dialogue which embraces both complexity and nuance. Attendees will be encouraged to reflect on their own assumptions, experiences, and roles within the system and to consider how they can leverage their power to contribute to meaningful systemic change."

Campbell’s work continues to shape the way child welfare workers engage with families to understand who they consider a support, and in what ways these individuals or groups can contribute to plans that ensure child safety. For communities that have always prioritized the interconnectedness of people, Family Finding® can feel like a validation of their lived experience, but it can also reveal relationship dynamics that require additional work to resolve so that network members can communicate and plan together."

    "description": "This session addresses the unintended harm of administratively focused child welfare supervision by reimagining it as a space for systemic accountability, emotional insight, and equitable decision making. Traditional models—often shaped by media scrutiny, public concern over child fatalities, and fear of reputational or policy consequences—have created risk-averse cultures that prioritize control and task completion over reflection and responsiveness. These dynamics can obscure systemic factors like racism and poverty in the assessment of families, while offering little space for workers to process complexity. This session explores how reflective, equity-centered supervision can deepen critical thinking and promote just, ethical practice."

    "description": "Along a child’s journey through the complexities of the child protection system there are pivotal moments that often occur. Moments such as when there is a breakdown in their foster placement and they need to move, or they are transitioning out of care into adulthood. All too often these moments occur is such a way that reinforce stories of brokenness, distrust and feelings of being unloved for the young people the system is attempting to protect. In this session, we will explore the concept of ‘moments that matter’ and how to intentionally design them in a way that is child-centered and trauma-informed to instead reinforce stories of trust, love and resilience – and the ripple effect of embedding these behaviors in pivot moments on day-to-day social work practice."

However, postpartum challenges such as mental health, substance use, economic hardship, and changed relationships can threaten this dyad and increase the risk of child maltreatment. Such challenges are often addressed through the child welfare system, which has led to tens of thousands of babies being removed from their mothers each year. While some removals may be necessary for child safety, many damage the dyad, introducing trauma that impacts mom and baby’s well-being throughout the life course. This strategy session calls for a re-examination infant removal from their mothers and discussion of proven strategies for safety and family unity for new families needing support."

But in 13 states they are not afforded the right to counsel to provide them essential legal protections and advice. The Counsel for Kids campaign, launched in 2021, has made strides to expand the right to counsel but has encountered barriers to policy reform including: ideas that youth do not know what is best for them or that youth cannot assist counsel in their legal representation.

In this session we will show that it isn't the changes that do you in; it's the transitions.

This profoundly destabilizing impact happens not only from committing what we know is wrong but also from witnessing transgressions and failing to keep them from happening. How do we heal ourselves? This session poses a series of questions to engage us in reclaiming the power of generosity in our close relationships, workplaces, and communities. The aim is not to learn how to apply steps for moral recovery. Instead, the intent is to open our hearts to acknowledge personal limitations, renew communal bonds, and restore hope and trust.

Ubuntu is one of the approaches that are central to social work in a decolonised and Afro centric way. Ubuntu fit well wit FGC as they are both indigenous approaches that place the child at the centre of all decision making, ensuring power is handed back to families. Data was gathered from social workers, FGC coordinators and child advocates in the UK using interviews and focus groups. The core of the thesis is the need to embody social work values and demonstrate ‘ubuntu’ in working with children and families. Findings suggest families are empowered through FGC use"

This session will meet workers where they are: in the tension between wanting to help and being asked to police, remove, or control.

Our multidisciplinary approach includes early staffing of cases for children in non-kin placements. This team-based model wraps around caseworkers and quickly identifies, evaluates, and supports kin options. This has reduced the time children spend in unrelated foster homes and helped decrease trauma caused by prolonged separation from family. We know that the sooner the children can be placed with their kin, the amount of trauma experienced can be reduced greatly."

    "title": "When Intimate Partner Violence Occurs: Healing the Family through Family-Based Interventions",
    "description": "Intimate partner violence is experienced by families around the world and can have a serious health and mental health impact on children and adults. Families may come under the guidance of Child Protective Services and the risk of child out of home placement is high. Common interventions for IPV do not address the couple, children, family, and extended family. The need is great to assure that all family members are part of the healing process. In this workshop we describe a model called Multisystemic Therapy for Intimate Partner Violence that has been implemented in Connecticut, USA for 8 years and whose goal is to keep families together safely. Importantly, we show the input from people with lived experience in the model development."

    "title": "Who is \"the Community\"? Building Bridges to Respond to Child Exploitation",
    "description": "Community-created and driven responses are increasingly being recognized as best practice for preventing and effectively addressing the exploitation of children and youth. Yet, as cities and regions take steps to replace system-driven approaches with community-based care, defining what \"community\" is and who is included is critical for developing productive relationships and unified responses, ultimately lending to positive and sustainable outcomes for impacted children, families, and communities. Informed by lessons learned in supporting communities design response models, the presenters will walk attendees through a proven framework for advancing community-led systemic change without compromising relationships, responses, and outcomes."

    "title": "Whole Family Advocacy: A Novel Partnership of Perinatal Nurse Home Visiting & Preventative Legal Aid",
    "description": "The child welfare system was not designed to respond to families’ unmet legal and social needs, many of which are the result of structural barriers. Families in need of critical legal and social supports are often left without access to non-punitive interventions and legal representation. This session will describe the integration of three powerful models of family advocacy - Philadelphia Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP), HELP: MLP, and the Penn Carey Law Interdisciplinary Child Advocacy Clinic - to create whole family advocacy: a novel model for interdisciplinary partnership outside of the child welfare system that can identify and address families’ unmet legal and social needs – and ultimately prevent child welfare interventions."

We will demonstrate how by working in partnership with members of our lived experience kinship carers' panel Family Rights Group we have achieved some positive change. Our work with central and local government, the judiciary, local authorities, academics, and other organisations have achieved some positive change but we also have challenges ahead in our campaign to promote and support the recognition and equality of kinship carers and the children they care for."
