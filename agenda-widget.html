       description: "Primary prevention of child maltreatment requires individuals, communities, and systems reach upstream to create healthy conditions for families to thrive. To achieve this aim, we must collectively understand where children and families achieve well-being, where there is opportunity for greater holistic support, and how cross-sector initiatives impact child and family well-being. The Kansas Child and Family Well-Being Pathway is a strengths-based, community-driven data dashboard and toolkit designed to understand and act to support local well-being. This session will explore The Pathway—a new, practical tool co-created with families, highlighting how data are made accessible and actionable and how communities can use the tool to spark meaningful, local impact.",

       description: "Emotional labor is defined as any piece of a job where a worker is responsible for both display rules of the organization as well as fostering an emotional climate where work goals can be met. First coined as a concept in the work of flight attendants, emotional labor is a primary component in our work in child and family service settings. It shows up when we help de-escalate conflict, when we empathize with families and children, and when we work to help families make needed changes. This skills session, facilitated by Ida Drury, PhD, MSW, will provide additional information on all the facets of emotional labor. Participants will complete a self-evaluation and talk about all the ways you practice emotional labor every day as well as strategies for resilience.",

In systems where children are too often invisible, we’ll centre child-inclusive practices within the context of their families and communities. Real-life examples—including hearing directly from children, will show how meaningful engagement helps children thrive in the context of family, culture, kin. Children will share what works, what doesn’t, and how we can improve. You'll also learn from international evidence on effective strategies, building a resilient workforce, and front-door innovations that prioritise children’s welfare.

Traditional models—often shaped by media scrutiny, public concern over child fatalities, and fear of reputational or policy consequences—have created risk-averse cultures that prioritize control and task completion over reflection and responsiveness. These dynamics can obscure systemic factors like racism and poverty in the assessment of families, while offering little space for workers to process complexity. This session explores how reflective, equity-centered supervision can deepen critical thinking and promote just, ethical practice.",

In this session, we will explore the concept of ‘moments that matter’ and how to intentionally design them in a way that is child-centered and trauma-informed to instead reinforce stories of trust, love and resilience – and the ripple effect of embedding these behaviors in pivot moments on day-to-day social work practice.",

So why, after 25 centuries, do social service organizations still struggle with change? In this session we will show that it isn't the changes that do you in; it's the transitions. When leaders do not support their employees through transition, there is resistance, lower morale, and confusion that ultimately leads to failed implementation.

Despite these alarming numbers, healthcare and social service systems have been slow to adapt to meet the needs of perinatal persons affected by substance use. Peer doulas offer an innovative approach by pairing professional birth support with lived experience of recovery from substance use disorder. Attendees will hear from peer doulas about their experiences supporting patients and their families.

       description: "This Phd research was conducted to look at the use of the African philosophy of Ubuntu to explore the use of the FGC model as culturally competent practice to collaborate with families to safeguard children from maltreatment. Ubuntu is one of the approaches that are central to social work in a decolonised and Afro centric way. Ubuntu fit well wit FGC as they are both indigenous approaches that place the child at the centre of all decision making, ensuring power is handed back to families. Data was gathered from social workers, FGC coordinators and child advocates in the UK using interviews and focus groups. The core of the thesis is the need to embody social work values and demonstrate ‘ubuntu’ in working with children and families. Findings suggest families are empowered through FGC use",

We focus on early and meaningful engagement with kin—not only for placement, but also as support networks for children, parents, and foster families. Our multidisciplinary approach includes early staffing of cases for children in non-kin placements. This team-based model wraps around caseworkers and quickly identifies, evaluates, and supports kin options. This has reduced the time children spend in unrelated foster homes and helped decrease trauma caused by prolonged separation from family. We know that the sooner the children can be placed with their kin, the amount of trauma experienced can be reduced greatly.",

The success of the virtual design during the pandemic has allowed us to partner with Missouri's Division of Social Services (DSS) as contractors to provide families working toward retaining custody of or reunification with their children with synchronous virtual parenting classes indefinitely.",
